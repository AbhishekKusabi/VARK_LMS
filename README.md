# AI-Driven Personalized Content Recommendations

## Overview

This project explores the use of **VARK (Visual, Aural, Read/Write, Kinesthetic) learning styles** and **Brain Dominance** traits to develop an AI-driven system for personalized educational content recommendations. By leveraging these frameworks, the system adapts learning materials to individual preferences, improving engagement and outcomes.

## Project Goals

- Utilize **VARK learning styles** to understand students' preferences.
- Integrate **Brain Dominance** traits to analyze cognitive strengths.
- Build a recommendation system that provides **personalized learning paths**.
- Use **AI/ML techniques** to predict learning preferences and recommend content.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Tracks student behavior, including time spent on videos, scroll depth, and progress.
- **AI-Driven Recommendations**: Employs machine learning models to predict learning styles and recommend content.
- **Personalized Learning Paths**: Tailors educational materials to individual learning styles and brain dominance traits.

## Technology Stack
